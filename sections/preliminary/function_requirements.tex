\subsection{Sensing}%
\label{sub:sensing}

It's critical that the robot is able to detect the two black lines that denote a tile. This is the foundation of the robot's ability collect feedback to where it is on the map.
The robot should also be able to detect whether it is pushing a can. This is not strictly needed as the path is not determined by the sensor, however, it can be nice for sanity checks.

\subsubsection{Map}%
\label{ssub:map}

The ability to accept input in the form of left, up, down and right, and because of this is able to complete a sokoban map.
The robot should be able to detect either side of a line to evaluate whether or not the robot is following the lines on the map.

\subsubsection{Tomat pur√© can}%
\label{ssub:tomat_pure_can}

For redundant checks to robot should be able to detect whether or not i is in contact with a can.

\subsection{Movement}%
\label{sub:movement}

The robot must have the ability to move around on a sokoban map. It must have various qualities that enables it to complete the objective of sokoban.

\subsubsection{Precision}%
\label{ssub:precision}

The robot should be precise with its movement as needing to recover is an expensive procedure in regards to time.
The ability to move with a can and somewhat precisely place it on a tile is also critical to be able to complete the objective of sokoban. It is also needed that the robot is able to capture a can with its inlet.

\subsubsection{Agility}%
\label{ssub:agility}

The robot should not be too long as to not be able to turn $180^{\circ}$ between to cans.

The robot should have the ability to turn and not interfere with a can adjacent to it while also adhering to the rules of sokoban. 

\subsection{Speed}%
\label{sub:speed}

The robot should be able to maintain a high constant velocity reliably. Ideally the robot should be able to execute a solution of 120 steps in the span of a few minutes.
