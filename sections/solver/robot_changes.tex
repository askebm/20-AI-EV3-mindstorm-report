Before looking at the two solvers created during this course a few changes has been made to the robot since the preliminary report. There has not been made any important changes that changes the way the robot navigates. The only change was removing the touch sensor that would be activated if the robot was pushing a can. This was done as there was interest in creating a more stable design by introducing an axle. No benefit was seen by making the change, however, the decision was to not reattach the touch sensor as the robot driving script made no use of it.
