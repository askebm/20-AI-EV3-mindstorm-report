Each solver has been tested 83 different maps pulled from this
\href{https://github.com/bravegnu/python-sokoban}{github repository}.
Not all maps in the repository is compatible with the map format provided in the project
and therefore only the 83 maps that can be converted to the project map format has been used.\\

For each map the following is tracked. Number of boxes, Elapsed real-time,
Total number of CPU-seconds spent in kernel mode, Total number of CPU-seconds spent in user-mode and whether it found a Solution.\\

Each solver was terminated if the process took more than 10GB of RAM and is counted as not finding a solution.

As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:boxplots}, seems to behave very much the same way, the only
difference being that A* has a higher mean. This indicates a suboptimal heuristic for the A*
as a bad A* will be explore a lot and use as much memory as breadth first.\\

Looking at the solve time in Figure~\ref{fig:boxplots_time} there is a clear difference between
Breadth First and A*. As can be seen A* spends more time solving the maps, but as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:solutions}, A* solves one more map than breadth first.\\

\subsubsection{Discussion}%
\label{ssub:discussion}
As the solution is calculated offline there is argument to be made for using the solver that can
solve the most maps, which here is A*.

A* was expected to significantly outperform Breadth First, by the nature of it being able move
more directly to the goal state without consuming a lot of memory.
As it does not it indicates that there exists a better heuristic for A*.
A more memory efficient alternative to A* star is IDA* which might be able solve more maps.
