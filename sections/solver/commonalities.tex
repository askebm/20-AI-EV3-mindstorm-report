State space.
Sokoban has a branching factor of 4 as the robot cannot move diagonally. \\	

Storing a state which includes all the box positions stored in a list and the player position is required to have 				sufficient 	information about a state. A state is called a node in this case. The state is stored in a dictionary where 		the key is a string of the levels layout. The node object itself is stored as the value. It is highly desirable that a 			state has a unique board position and a node also stores what node its parent and children are.
