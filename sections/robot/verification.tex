\label{sub:what_factors_will_affect_the_speed_and_reliability_of_the_robot_}

\begin{itemize}
	\item As the robot relies on color sensors, its line tracking ability will be susceptible to
		noise from changing lighting conditions.
	\item The speed of the robot is mostly affected by its ability to accelerate and decelerate to
		quickly and safely traverse corners. Also to not tip over cans if hitting them at to great a
		speed.
	\item The built quality of the robot is important as the robot might fall apart if it is not
		constructed robustly
\end{itemize}
