\subsection{Verification}%
\label{sub:verification}

Testing whether the functional requirements match the implementation is critical.
The robot must pass various tests that test whether its sensors responds as desired. The tests include testing whether but are not limited to that movement is precise enough and its ability to move a tomat pur√© can from one tile to another. These tests will help to understand whether the robot is able to complete a sokoban map correctly, abiding by all the rules of the game.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Beginning of new tile (cross) detection
	
	\item Ability to turn, $90^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$
	
	\item How precise the turning is. Testing whether the robot loses "sight". It is desired that the color sensors line up with the new black line after the robot has turned from its original orientation.
	
	\item Ability to capture a can
	
	\item Ability to place a can on a tile
	
	\item Able to convert input to actions
	
	
\end{itemize}
